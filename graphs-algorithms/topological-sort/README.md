# Topological Sort

###

### Definition
A _topological sort_ of a _directed graph_
is a _linear ordering_ of its _vertices_ such that for every
directed edge *(u, v)* from vertex _u_ to vertex _v_, _u_ comes before
_v_ in the ordering.

If a graph has cycles or is not directed, then there is no
topological sort.
